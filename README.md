# TicTacToe-2018

This repository is the **Master Repository.**

Each **team** should have **one** member of the team make a _fork_ of the master repository. This will be the **Team Repository.** The owner of the team repository should create a _branch_ <team name>-master. For example, the owner (forker) of the UI team repository would create a branch called **ui-master**.

On each team, each member of the team should make a fork of their **team repository** (not of this repository). This will be your **Individual Repository.** Once you have your individual repository, create a branch for your _pull requests_ and call it <your-name>-master - thus, my branch would be called **doug-master**.

## Use of branches

The _master branches_ are for **running code** - when you _commit_ work to a master branch it should represent a milestone that you want to share with your team. When the team merges changes into the master branch of the team repository, those changes should represent work that is ready to share with the other teams.

For development work, make a new branch and do the work there. When the code is working, merge it with your master branch.

## Pull requests

To merge your code into the team repository, or to merge the team's work into the master repository. Make a _pull request._
